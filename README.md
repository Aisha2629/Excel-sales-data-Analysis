Downloaded this dataset from kaggle.My main goal was identify whats driving the profit,understand 
the sales trends and see where we can target for better salesÂ andÂ profit.Used Excel to Manipulate,Analyse 
and visualize data.

Purpose:
My goal in utilizing the multi-year sales data, sales by category, sales by subcategories, and top 10 
revenue states was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of our sales performance across different dimensions.
By examining sales trends over multiple years, analyzing sales by category and subcategories and
identifying the top revenue-generating states, I aimed to gain a holistic view of our sales landscape.
 This analysis will enable us to make data-driven decisions, optimize our sales strategies and 
ultimately drive businessÂ growth.

Findings:
-Year 2017 having the highest sales followed by 2016, 2015, and 2014 indicates a positive trend in the company's growth each financial year.
-It's interesting to note that the "Technology" category consistently performed well in terms of sales and profit across almost every year.
-Identifying the top 10 subcategories that generated the maximum sales, with Phones and Chairs leading the purchases, provides valuable insight into consumer preferences.
-California leading in sales, followed by New York, Texas, and Washington, highlights key states for targeting sales efforts.
- Achieving a profit margin of 12.8% is a significant accomplishment and shows the company's ability to generate profitÂ effectively.

- With significant growth in sales and profit observed each year, it's evident that the business is on a positive trajectory. Leveraging this growth momentum to further optimize strategies and capitalize on opportunities will be key to sustaining and enhancing businessÂ success.Â ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
